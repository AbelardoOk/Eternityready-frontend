The word \u201cbroadcast\u201d is an agricultural term that means to scatter seed indiscriminately over a wide area. It is our joy and privilege to make the Gospel available to anyone and everyone who chooses to listen.\n\nWe seek the salvation of souls, the baptism of believers, and the growth and nurturing of Christians. We understand that in America most listeners are already Christians. Therefore, we focus on motivating our listeners to actively pursue the lost, and to live out their faith on a daily basis, through KJV Bible preaching and teaching, and Old Time Gospel Music.\n\nWith a year around average of twelve hours of broadcasting per day, we further seek to provide interesting, informative, and entertaining programming that will offer Christians an alternative to secular and worldly entertainment. As a communication vehicle, we seek to promote better fellowship between believers who are \u201clike minded in the faith\u201d. Lastly, we seek to praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and intercede in prayer for our listeners, our nation, and other ministries who are striving to reach the world for Christ.",

It was also decided at that time that JOY99 would be a local for-profit commercial supported station.  We wanted to be funded by the local businesses, not our listeners, for operating expenses allowing listeners to support non-profit organizations.  We have never tallied it up, but a conservative estimate would say that JOY99 listeners have given more than 3 million dollars to nonprofits over that time through on-air fundraising campaigns.

I pray a blessing and a hedge of protection over all listeners who worship Jesus with this radio broadcast.

There's no distance in prayer.  Prayer is the only wireless connection that is free.  lol  This Internet radio broadcast is back on the air.  It will forever remain free.    .....  Worship Messiah Jesus is a free Internet radio broadcast with the goal of magnifying The Lord Jesus Christ's Presence, the Anointed One Who breaks our yokes and strongholds when He lives inside our praises (Psalm 22:3).  This station believes Abba Father God Yahweh's Word became flesh (and blood) by the power of His Holy Spirit and dwelt among us and Jesus Christ is God With Us, and Jesus Christ embodies the Godhead as Adonai (Lord) (Colossians 2:9).  Jesus Christ was God's soul and perfect Divine Will on the Cross because Jesus Christ became our sins, iniquity, and insanities and diseases & infirmities that he suffered in our place, and crucified them and died with them.  Jesus Christ, just like Moses' brazen snake on the stake for the people to be healed from God's punishments by looking up at it (John 3:14-17).  However, Christ Jesus rose from the dead grave on the third day, and our sins and iniquities and insanities & diseases are still dead.  All you have to do is humble yourself and be sorry for your sins and ask God to forgive you and to take them away from you, and ask Jesus to come into your heart and ask Him for forgiveness and the Holy Ghost to help you live for Him, and Father God will do it.  The one and only priority and perfect will of God for you is to believe on Jesus Christ, the One through Whom Father God sent His Word to you.  Contact me at anna@annamaria.live",

There is no true Joy without Jesus.  The Bible repeats over and over the command to bring Joy, sing for Joy, shout for Joy, cries of Joy, find Joy, choose Joy, and even to share Joy.  We feel we are called to share exactly that\u2026Joy!\n\n\nWhy Worship?\nWhat greater honor could we have than to Worship to the King of Kings!  In Luke 4, we are commanded to \u201cworship the Lord our God\u201d.  Do we really need a command to worship the amazing God who made the heavens and the earth?  Just breath to breathe is reason enough, not to mention the incredible inheritance we have coming.  It is an absolute honor to have the privilege to come before His presence with singing!  Great practice for the day we are worshipping Him face to face. ",

We\u2019ve been there. Do you have a drawer that used to hold useful stuff like pens and sticky notes, but now has junk mail, a broken stapler, and a half eaten bag of gummy worms? Yeah, us too.\n\nSure, KTSY plays Christian music, but that\u2019s not because we think we are better than other people. It\u2019s because we know what it\u2019s like to live life without encouragement, friendship, or hope. It\u2019s not great!\n\nWe desire to show people a way out of loneliness and disappointment. Everybody does that a little bit differently. We make it happen by playing music about Jesus, talking about life, and acting a little crazy. You can do it!",
