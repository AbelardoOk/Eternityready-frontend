But there was one determined to see this fledging faith exterminated. His name was Saul and he became the greatest persecutor of the early church. But within a matter of a few years, the Christians fiercest opponent became their most effective advocate. Struck down by a powerful conversion experience on the road to Damascus, Saul -- his name changed to Paul -- went on to become the greatest missionary in the history of Christianity. He went on to write more of the New Testament books than any other.

Ultimately the film’s message is about Jesus' final prayer for his followers:“May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me….” John 17:23Scriptural truths communicated in this film and the accompanying study guide are relevant to the issues that today deeply divide the local church, the nation, and the Church worldwide. This film is meant to challenge the viewer to become a ‘Peacemaker’ in a world that is desperate for the true peace that only Jesus can bring—peace with God and peace with one another.",

      "description": "This is a survey course designed to further stimulate your curiosity by providing glimpses of some of the pivotal events in the spread Christianity and sketches of great Christian figures who have significantly affected Christian history thereby shaping the history of the world. Kit includes six half-hour programs, leader's guide, program scripts, and reproducible student workbook.PART I: The Early Church -- From the executions of Peter and Paul in Rome to the death of Augustine in North Africa, we follow the Early Church as she emerges from the womb of Judaism to survive horrendous persecution and become established in the Roman world. Explore what took place at the early Ecumenical Councils and how the great doctrines of the Church were formulated.PART II: The Church in the Middle Ages -- During this period in history, universities, monasteries, and museums were established. The Church, with her majestic Cathedrals, joined these institutions in influencing society. But this interaction with culture was not without difficulties: barbarian invasion, crusades, the Muslim challenge. Also, during this period, Christendom was divided into the Eastern Church and the Western Church.PART III: The Reformation -- It was an age of exploration and discovery, of art and literature. The Medieval Church, however, had placed too much emphasis on the church as an institution. As a result, the papacy enjoyed unusual power often coupled with unusual corruption. Cries of reform were heard all over Europe. The Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century was a tremendous movement of spiritual and ecclesial renewal.PART IV: The Age of Reason and Piety -- During the two centuries between the death of Martin Luther in 1546 and the conversion of John Wesley in 1738, the Christian world experienced a major paradigm shift from an \"age of faith\" to an \"age of reason.\" On the heels of Copernicus' discovery that the earth is not the center of the universe, rose \"the Enlightenment\" -- a movement that shifted the focus away from God and to human creativity.PART V: Christianity in the New World -- America was the land of new beginnings. Europe represented for Americans a corrupt past, whose contamination they wished to escape. This period includes the study of great traditions such as the Puritans and Quakers, and great movements such as the First Great Awakening.PART VI: Christian Movement in an Age of Uncertainty -- From the fall of Bastille in 1789 (marking the beginning of the French Revolution) to the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 (marking the end of communism), study the Christian movement in an age of uncertainty. William Carey, the \"father of modern missions\" carries the Gospel to India; others followed to remote regions -- people like David Livingstone, Lottie Moon, Henry Martyn, and Hudson Taylor. Explore the Christian Church as it moves into all the world.Director: Mona Hurlbert Fisher, Maria Demeshkina PeekStarring: Dr. Timothy George",

As he was reflecting on the beatitudes in light of his journey with cancer, Ken wanted to learn from people who knew well the brokenness Jesus describes as blessed. This one-hour documentary presents the stories of inmates that bring clarity to Jesus’ teaching as they share the blessedness of the beatitudes in their own lives. Many of these men are facing life sentences, yet they have found new life and purpose through their faith in Jesus Christ.Ken also interviews Angola’s iconic prison warden, Burl Cain, who famously transformed Angola from one of the most violent prisons in America to one of the most peaceful through a program he calls “moral rehabilitation.” Today hundreds of Angola’s inmates attend a seminary inside the prison and participate in ministry to fellow inmates and their families. Some even become missionaries to other correctional institutions.Blessedness out of Brokenness demonstrates the power of God to transform the darkest of circumstances into opportunities for mission.",

You take comfort in knowing the principle of humiliation before promotion—that God often takes someone low before raising him up for His use.And that’s what happened when Ray Comfort was christened “Banana Man” by Professor Richard Dawkins. Millions came under the sound of the everlasting gospel, all because of that humiliating name: Banana Man. So if you’re afraid of looking foolish, this true story in \"The Fool\" will not only will encourage you and bring your fears into perspective, it will increase your faith in God and help you to see His wonderful hand in your own life.",

But the Bible tells a different story: An Almighty Creator who recently spoke creation into existence, created animals after their kinds and Adam and Eve to rule over them. Do these museums really make better sense of the fossils from the past? Or, does the Bible’s account of Creation, the Fall, and the Flood fit the evidence better? This video evaluates the leading evidences that are presented in these museums from a both a biblical and scientific perspective: the Human-Chimp 99% Myth, key ape-to-human icons like Ardipithecus ramidus, “Lucy” the Australopithecus, Homo habilis, Neanderthals, the Human Family “Tree,” Darwin’s Finches, the fossil record and transitional forms, Continental drift and Pangea, Dinosaurs, and deep time based on radiometric dating.",

This cinema drama follows the life of John Wesley from when he was saved out of a burning house as a child and thereby marked for life as a \"brand from the burning.\" His Oxford days, a disastrous mission to America, his decisive Aldersgate experience, his bringing the Gospel into the daily lives of alienated masses, the founding of Methodism, and his astounding role in raising the moral and religious climate in 18th century England, and much more are set forth with careful dependence on the historical sources. John Wesley was one of the most influential ministers in all of Christian history, and this old but still potent film provides an excellent introduction to the major events in his life and the many obstacles he had to overcome.Director: Norman WalkerStarring: Leonard Sachs",

They went, willing to become slaves if necessary, to minister to these oppressed people. The Moravians pioneered a mission movement characterized by extraordinary commitment. Under the dynamic leadership of Count Nikolaus von Zinzendorf, the Moravians sent out more missionaries in 20 years than all the other Protestant groups had in 200 years. They were driven by two strong convictions: world evangelization is a prime obligation of the church, and every member of the Christian community has this responsibility. First Fruits unfolds the suffering which these young men endured for their missionary zeal and the agony of their community in deciding to send them forth at a time when missions to the heathen masses were unthinkable among Protestants. You will especially marvel over the \"first fruits\" of their ministry and the impact of their vision on the course of Christian history.Director: Dan NeidermyerStarring: Richard Foster, Todd Hoagey, Dan Neidermyer",

But in South Carolina during the 1920s, the only path to pro baseball is through the local textile mill team. Against the wishes of his wealthy father, Will leaves his family and privileged life behind to work in the harsh conditions at Newton Mill. His natural talent on the field makes him the rising star of the mill-league team—and also earns him a dangerous rival as well as criticism from his father for his association with working class “undesirables.” Milltown Pride is set in a time and place of deep social and spiritual division. As a so-called “Town-Boy,” Will lives a sheltered and ideal life marked by games of croquet and Sunday School picnics while the local Mill workers live a hand to mouth existence often falling prey to the temptation of the local moonshine which pervades the prohibition era south.

Heidi (Jennifer Edwards), a young orphan girl, is sent to live with her grandfather (Michael Redgrave) in the beautiful Swiss Alps. The gruff and bitter old man views Heidi at first as an ill-mannered child and an unwanted responsibility, but he soon becomes quite attached to her. When Heidi is sent to Frankfurt to be a companion to Clara (Zuleika Robson), the crippled daughter of successful businessman Herr Richard Sesemann (Maximilian Schell), Heidi and her grandfather are saddened at their parting. Heidi finds Clara’s governess, Fraulein Rottenmeier (Jean Simmons), to be a kind woman, but the spoiled Clara is mean to Heidi. Heidi soon wins her over, though, and they become good friends. Still homesick, Heidi is sent on a two-week visit with her grandfather and is later joined by Clara. It is there that Clara overcomes her fears and learns to walk. This endearing drama, with a romantic subplot between Herr Sesemann and Fraulein Rottenmeier, features exemplary acting and a magnificent music score.

Featuring the voices of Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) and John Rhys-Davies (Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones).Many Beautiful Things tells the story of Lilias Trotter, a 19th century British painter who sacrificed artistic fame in order to serve God as a missionary in Algeria. Trotter's extraordinary gift was noticed by famous art critic, John Ruskin who believed Trotter could become one of England's greatest artists. But to Ruskin's consternation, Trotter's unfailing love for the needy and those without Christ led her to focus on ministry and in time Trotter could not escape God's undeniable calling to serve on the mission field. This remarkable story challenges Christians to ask themselves key questions such as, \"What is God asking me to do with the gifts I have?\" and \"What would I be willing to sacrifice in order to be faithful to Christ?\" Trotter's profound spiritual insights were featured in the book, A Path Through Suffering by Elisabeth Elliot. This program is recommended for anyone who desires to be encouraged and challenged in their pursuit of God.

Do we really understand the profound importance and authenticity of the birth of Jesus? Why the Virgin Mary? Why a carpenter named Joseph?

And why are the Old Testament prophecies that predicted the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem so important to the Christmas story?Drawing from both the Old and New Testaments, noted pastor, author, and theologian Dr. David Jeremiah answers some of the most thought-provoking questions surrounding the most pivotal moment in human history—the birth of Jesus Christ.Travel back in time and experience the sights and sounds of that first Christmas. You’ll have a front-row seat to the Nativity story as you witness the Old Testament prophets foretelling the birth of Jesus, Gabriel appearing to Mary, Joseph and Mary traveling the road to the crowded city of Bethlehem, angels appearing to shepherds, the brilliant star guiding the Wise Men from the East, and baby Jesus lying in a manger in a humble stable in Bethlehem.Why the Nativity? is a fascinating presentation of biblical history, with stunning visual dramatics that create an unforgettable journey through the wonders of Christmas!",

There he encountered so much hardship it is amazing he didn't abandon his mission and go home. But he stayed for over 40 years. One issue that tormented him was sati—the burning alive of widows when their husbands died. He would not rest until this practice was stopped. Facing insurmountable odds, he \"plodded\" on to influence the abolition of sati and to become the revered \"Friend of India\" and \"Father of Modern Missions.\" He oversaw more translations of the Bible than had been done in all previous Christian history combined. Life was never easy for Carey. But he simply refused to quit, even when a devastating fire destroyed years of his literary work. His legacy has inspired countless others from his own day to the present. William Carey shows dramatically how a life dedicated to God and obedient to His calling can make a profound difference in the world.

Rather, it is a battle for the truth. Is God real? Does He speak, and if so, how would we know? While many churches are faithfully proclaiming the truths found in Scripture, others have lost confidence in the Bible's divine authorship.The God Who Speaks is a 90-minute documentary that traces the evidence of the Bible’s authority through interviews with some of the world’s most respected biblical scholars. This film answers common objections about the Bible’s reliability and equips believers to confidently base their lives on the power of God’s Word.The God Who Speaks was produced by American Family Studios, a division of American Family Association. The mission of the American Family Association is to inform, equip, and activate individuals to strengthen the moral foundations of American culture, and give aid to the church here and abroad in its task of fulfilling the Great Commission.

On the surface, it appears that the struggle between Tony and Joe, two best friends who both love Emily, hinges on Joe obtaining an annulment of his first marriage, so Emily, a devout Catholic, can marry him. Only Tony can testify to the truth and make the annulment a reality for Joe, but Tony still loves Emily, his ex-girlfriend. In reality, the struggle is for the souls of all three. Tony has been trying to come back to God because he wants Emily, and his heart tells him he has to be the best man he can be for her. Joe doesn't run as spiritually or emotionally deep as Tony, but he loves Emily, too, and he wants to do the right thing. Both Tony and Joe have to decide if they will make the sacrifice necessary to love Emily. She, in turn, must decide whether she truly loves Joe, or Tony. As they each fight for whom they love, the Tribunal slowly answers the ever-present question hanging over the proceedings, \"What does God want?\" Why it matters to these three is the reason it matters to every person. Our souls will not rest until they rest in the arms of the Lord.Director: Marc LeifWriter: Michael C. MerglerStars: Ryan Wesley Gilreath, Chris Petty, Laura E.

      "description": "Christian Movie | \"Who's Nailing God to the Cross Again?\"Gu Shoucheng is a pastor in a house church in China. He has believed in the Lord for many years, and has been working consistently on his sermons, and he has been all over preaching the gospel. He has been arrested and imprisoned because of preaching the gospel, and did 12 years' time. After getting out of prison, Gu Shoucheng continued to work in the church. However, when Almighty God's gospel of the kingdom came upon the church that Gu Shoucheng belongs to, he doesn't seek or investigate it at all, but stubbornly relies upon his own notions and conceptions to condemn God's work in the last days, and he does everything he can to disseminate notions and fallacies to disrupt and block believers from accepting the true way. It was particularly after reading the words of Almighty God that Gu Shoucheng discovered that they truly possessed authority and power and that whoever heard them would be convinced, and he became deeply afraid that anyone in the church who read the words of Almighty God would become a believer in Him. He feared that then his status and his living would become unsustainable. So, he discussed this with Elder Wang Sen and others in the church and decided to deceive people with rumors used by the Chinese Communist government attacking and condemning Almighty God. Gu Shoucheng and Wang Sen do their utmost to seal up the church and block the people from accepting the true way, and they even cooperate with the CCP satanic regime to arrest and persecute those who bear witness to Almighty God. Their actions seriously offend God's disposition and are subject to His curse.

For more than twenty years, he enthusiastically served the Lord, fully concentrated on studying the Bible. Following the example of his religious leaders, he thought that believing in the Lord meant believing in the Bible, and that having faith in the Bible was exactly the same as having faith in the Lord. He believed that so long as he adhered to the Bible, he would be raptured into the kingdom of heaven. These conceptions constrained him like a pair of shackles, restraining him from following God's footsteps and believing in God. As a result, Lee Chungmin never thought to look into Almighty God's work of the last days …One day, by complete chance, he watched some hymnal videos on The Church of Almighty God's website. Their stirring lyrics and elegant melodies deeply moved him, inspiring him to look into Almighty God's work of the last days. After undergoing a few debates about the truth, he came to understand the inside story of the Bible through Almighty God's words. He came to understand the true facts of the situation clearly: The Pharisees of the religious world oppose and condemn God's appearance and work under the guise of elevating the Bible. Eventually, he cast aside the controls and restraints of the religious Pharisees and caught up with God's footprints …",

Always she enthusiastically does the Lord's work of spreading the gospel, vigilantly awaiting the Lord's coming to bring her up to the heavenly kingdom. In recent years, Li Qingxin has seen that assorted denominations have become ever more desolate. Eastern Lightning, however, has become ever more vibrant, despite frenzied condemnation and persecution by the Chinese Communist government and religious circles. More and more good sheep and leading sheep of various denominations have accepted Eastern Lightning. This causes Li Qingxin to do some introspection. In particular, she has seen that pastors and elders of religious circles don't hesitate to fabricate assorted rumors and nonsense to condemn and blacken the name of The Church of Almighty God. They even coordinate with the Chinese Communist government to arrest preachers of Eastern Lightning. She feels that the deeds and actions of the pastor and elder deviate from the way of the Lord, and she realizes that what the Chinese Communist Party and religious circles wildly resist and condemn may be the true way, and could be the manifestation and work of the Lord. Thereon she and some co-workers decide to seek out and investigate Eastern Lightning, but they encounter all means of obstruction and trouble from the pastor and elder. Through reading the words of Almighty God and listening to testimony by preachers of The Church of Almighty God, Li Qingxin and the others gain the ability to discern the rumors and fallacies of the pastor and elder. This allows them to understand the contemptible intent and vicious tricks in their obstructing followers from investigating the true way, and they see clearly the true colors of the pastor and elder as hypocrites. Li Qingxin and the others say in full voice to the religious pastor and elder, \"Stay out of our business!\" They are finally able to thoroughly cast off the entrapment and bondage of the pastor and elder, and return before the throne of God.",

      "description": "English Christian Movie \"Deadly Ignorance\" | Who Should We Listen to in Welcoming the Lord's Return?Zheng Mu'en is a co-worker at a Chinese Christian church in the US, has believed in the Lord for many years, and passionately works and expends for the Lord. One day, his aunt testifies to him that the Lord Jesus has returned to express the truth and do the work of judging and purifying man in the last days, news which greatly excites him. After reading Almighty God's word and watching the movies and videos of The Church of Almighty God, Zheng Mu'en's heart verifies that Almighty God's words are the truth, and that Almighty God might very well be the return of the Lord Jesus, so he begins investigating the work of God in the last days with his brothers and sisters. But when Pastor Ma, the leader of his church, discovers this, he tries time and again to intervene and stop Zheng Mu'en. He shows Zheng Mu'en a CCP government propaganda video that slanders and condemns Eastern Lightning in an attempt to make Zheng Mu'en abandon his investigation of the true way, and this video leaves him very confused: He can obviously see that Almighty God's words are the truth and the voice of God, so why do the pastors and elders of the religious world condemn Almighty God? They not only themselves refuse to seek or investigate, they try to stop others from accepting the true way. Why is this? … Zheng Mu'en fears being deceived and taking the wrong path, but also fears losing his chance to be raptured. In the midst of his conflict and confusion, Pastor Ma presents even more negative propaganda from the CCP and the religious world, producing many more doubts in Zheng Mu'en's heart. He decides to listen to Pastor Ma and give up his investigation of the true way. Later, after hearing testimony and fellowship from witnesses of The Church of Almighty God, Zheng Mu'en understands that in investigating the true way, the most fundamental principle is determining whether a way has the truth and whether what it expresses is the voice of God. Anyone that can express much of the truth must be the appearance of Christ, because no member of corrupt mankind could ever express the truth. This is an indisputable fact. If one does not focus on hearing the voice of God as they investigate the true way, and instead awaits the descent of the Lord Jesus on white clouds based on their imaginings, they will never be able to welcome the appearance of God. Zheng Mu'en finally understands the mystery of the wise virgins hearing God's voice spoken of by the Lord Jesus, decides to no longer believe the lies and absurd theories of the CCP government and the pastors and elders of the religious world, and escapes the constraints and bondage of his religious pastor. Zheng Mu'en experiences deeply the difficulty of investigating the true way. Without discernment or seeking the truth, there is no way to hear the voice of God or be raptured before God's throne. Instead, one can only be deceived and controlled by Satan and die in Satan's net, which entirely fulfills the words in the Bible, \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge\" (Hos 4:6). \"Fools die for want of wisdom\" (Pro 10:21).",

Under the guidance of the words of Almighty God, she and her brothers and sisters united to rely upon God, and began one intense debate after another with people of the religious world. In the end, the truth prevailed over falsehood, and more and more people who thirsted for God's appearance were conquered by the words of Almighty God and firmly believed that Almighty God was the second coming of the Lord Jesus, they all broke free of the constraints and bondage of their pastors and elders, the antichrists of the religious world.

      "description": "Full Gospel Movie \"Break Through the Snare\" | Seeing Through Rumors and Welcoming the Lord's ReturnThe Bible says, \"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God\" (1 Peter 4:17). In the last days, Almighty God expresses all the truth which purifies and saves man and He shows to us His righteous, majestic and inviolable disposition. God's work of judgment in the last days is done to save man so they can break away from the influence of Satan and truly turn back to God. All God's chosen people who accept Almighty God's work of judgment all gradually come to see clearly the factual truth that the pastors and elders' service of God actually defies God, see clearly their hypocritical and truth-hating antichrist natures and therefore they break away from the misleading and control of the pastors and elders and truly return before God. By listening to God's chosen people's testimonies of their experiences of judgment before the seat of Christ, you will be brought to an understanding of God's work of judgment in the last days.The heroine of this movie is one of those countless believers. When she first heard Almighty God's gospel of the last days, she was misled by the rumors of the CCP government and the religious leaders. She was trapped, lost in her confusion … After several intense debates, Almighty God's words led her to realize the truth, and she was finally able to see through the actual facts behind the rumors. She broke through the snare and beheld the appearance of the true God …",

JohnsonWriters: Abby Boolman, MaKayla BoolmanStars: Matt Moore, Tara Brandenberger, Sharon NelsonGenre: DramaRuntime: 1h 23minCountry: USALanguage: EnglishRelease Date: 20 May 2017 (USA)Filming Locations: Decatur, Indiana, USAStoryline:Jamie, a typical teenage girl who struggles to follow her families rules, is about to have her world turned upside down. A sudden tragic death in the family sends Jamie and her parents into a downward spiral with her parents blaming each other and her. Jamie is feeling lost and alone and searching for hope and an answer to end her guilt. Jamie’s friend helps her to find the hope she has been missing in God. Will her parents find God to dissolve their anger and find hope in this difficult world?Review:\"Tragedy strikes a family when the teen daughter disobeys her parents. The movie is based around this tragedy. Everyone in the family gets stuck in the cycle of blame - blaming either themselves or another family member. This ultimately leads to threats of divorce. Friends and neighbors step in to support them sharing their own, similar fates and how they moved forward. It's a story of loss and redemption. I needed tissues a few times and could hear loud sobs from others in the theater.The script was written by a group of teens taking a summer camp film class. I didn't know this until I came here to review. It was so well written that I want to see it again. However, it makes sense in many ways. It's a story of a teenager and a family falling apart. Many teens know what an unraveling family feels and looks like. There were a few moments though were the script failed. There is a young girl sharing her faith who used very technical terms which didn't have an authentic feel. However the rest of the writing more than overshadowed those moments. The actors were well cast and felt real, not like Hollywood types. The setting was small town America and looked authentic. The only aspect that was not so good was the camera. Shots were often shaky and had a low quality sound and look at times. It seemed like perhaps another camera was used later that was steadier and clearer.\" Written by thogg-94412 on IMDb.\"Truly a touching and heartfelt production. I was brought to tears more than once. No matter the trials or tribulations we may face on earth, our Father is by our side and there is always hope as long as we believe and trust in Him. Must admit, seeing Matt, who is steadfast and strong in his faith, playing the role of Michael. I adored the movie!\" Written by wildkat-12437 on IMDb.",

Particularly since Xi Jinping became President the CCP's attacks on faith have reached a peak, and even the officially sanctioned Three-Self Church is being eradicated and crosses are being torn down.Yu Congguang is an evangelist who makes a dangerous escape from a CCP mass arrest. Afterward, he makes his way to the home of Three-Self Patriotic Movement Christian Chen Song'en. Chen Song'en's Three-Self Patriotic Movement church is demolished by the CCP, and some in the church, after listening to the teachings of their pastors and elders, pray for the CCP regime, believing that by doing so, they are keeping the words of the Lord Jesus, \"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\" (Matthew 5:44). However, many believers are confused, because despite the fact that they have prayed for blessings for the CCP for so many years, the CCP has not only failed to repent, but has even demolished their church. They wonder: Does praying for the CCP actually accord with God's will? The congregation argues about the question but can't reach a conclusion. Later, through reading God's words and the fellowship of Yu Congguang and his associate, Chen Song'en and the others learn the true meaning of the Lord Jesus' teaching to \"love your enemies.\" They also gain discernment of the CCP's satanic essence, which is to resist God and loathe the truth, and clearly see the dangerous consequences of following the pastors and elders down the Three-Self path and relying on the protection of a satanic ruling power",

Believing in the misconceptions spread by religious pastors and elders, she continued to insist that \"the Lord Jesus has already forgiven man's sins, and those who believe in the Lord will always be saved. They don't need to accept God's work in the last days.\" She opposed and rejected Almighty God's gospel of the kingdom time and time again…. However, an unexpected incident gave her the opportunity to discover that her pastor behaved a certain way in front of people, and showed his true face behind their backs, and she was able to see her pastor for the hypocrite he was. It was then when Almighty God's gospel of the kingdom came to her. Witnesses from The Church of Almighty God patiently fellowshiped about and bore testimony to God's work of the last days for her, and after hearing the words of Almighty God, she was able to understand the truth about the difference between being saved and attaining full salvation and realize that the notions she had adhered to earlier were mere figments of man's imagination and do not accord with the reality of God's work. And so, she happily accepted the work of Almighty God in the last days. However, when her pastor learned this, he incited the believers to condemn and abandon her, even getting her family to pressure Lu Xiu'en…. Lu Xiu'en sunk into pain and was at a complete loss. In the end, she was able to understand the truth from Almighty God's words, and she could see that her pastor of the religious world was a hypocrite, an enemy of God who hated the truth with the demonic nature of an antichrist. Lu Xiu'en had awakened completely, and she rejected the deception and control of her pastor. She followed Almighty God, taking the path to pursue the truth and attain full salvation",

This movie accomplished this while being entertaining.The subject matter is powerful in a time when more families are blending faiths and dealing with the issue inherent in this blending. The plot move fast enough to be engaging and slowly enough to allow the viewer to come to terms with the twists happening in each scene. I look forward to seeing more work by this team and hope that more films are released in the near future. As the team works together they will make the small changes that will help them make the adjustments that will close the gap between this excellent first film and the work of more experienced companies.\" Written by raveric via IMDb.com\"My daughter, Alexis and I watched \"Sound of the Spirit\" last night.

She ends up arrested along with a church deacon, Zhao Guilan. In an effort to obtain information regarding other church leaders and where church funds are kept, the police interrogate and pressure them to answer their questions in turn, even using tactics such as beating them and suspending them from handcuffs. Seeing that Chen Xinjie refuses to speak, they take her to a secret interrogation location, strip off all her clothing to humiliate her, and electrocute her until she loses consciousness. When she feels that she is hovering between life and death, she uses her last bit of strength to call out to God in prayer. While unconscious, she sees a chorus of angels singing a hymn of God's words to encourage her, leading her back from the brink of death. She stands firm in her faith and swears to bear witness to God to humiliate Satan. Seeing their brutal torture methods aren't working with her, the police seek out her husband in an attempt to tug on her heartstrings to coerce and entice her into betraying God and selling out the church. They dispatch spies twice to get close to Chen Xinjie and gain information on the church. By leaning on God, she doesn't fall for Satan's tricks, but the police still refuse to give up. Then on one windy, snowy day, they transport both Chen Xinjie and Zhao Guilan to a reeducation through labor camp where they are forced to strip off their clothes in front of hundreds of prisoners, exposing their naked bodies in front of everyone",

Just how should we pursue to become people who do the heavenly Father's will and are obedient to God, so that God will bring us into the kingdom of heaven?Christian Song Enze was arrested and imprisoned by the Chinese Communist Party for seven years because he believed in God and preached God's gospel. After his release, he insisted on continuing to expend for God by spreading the gospel. He feels that by forsaking his home and career, laboring, and working, he is doing God's will, and that he is certain to gain God's approval and be brought into the kingdom of heaven by God. Later, Song Enze's son becomes seriously ill, putting his life in danger, over which Song Enze bears a grudge against God, attempts to argue with God, and even loses his desire to do his duties. Through what is shown to him by the facts of his situation and the revelations in God's word, Song Enze realizes that his many years of forsaking and expending for God were originally an attempt to barter for God's grace and blessings, and that he is not someone obedient to God. Finally, through seeking, he finally learns how to pursue to escape his corrupt dispositions, become truly obedient to God, and be saved by God.",

During interrogation, the police repeatedly coaxed, threatened, battered and tortured her in their attempts to seduce her to betray God by disclosing the whereabouts of the leaders and money of the church. Particularly in one frozen night when the temperature was twenty degrees below zero, she was forcibly stripped naked, drenched with icy water, electrically shocked on her lower area, and force-fed mustard water by the police…. She had suffered brutal torture and unimaginable humiliation. During the interrogation, she felt hurt and humiliated. She desperately prayed to God time after time. The word of God gave her timely enlightenment and guidance. With the faith and strength she received from God's word, she overcame the savage torture and demonic ravage and gave wonderfully resounding witness.

He and his wife move to Philadelphia so he can take a new job as an outreach leader at an old church whose membership has been declining. Just as he starts connecting with the community, he discovers that directly across the street from the church is an abortion clinic. He goes to the pastor and several others in the church trying to get their help--to no avail. One day he's going around his everyday routine when a personal tragedy strikes; this brings him to the point that he starts to take action himself, but the more involved he gets, the more resistance he gets from those in the church and community, and from his wife, who thinks his actions will get him fired or jailed. Finally he must make a choice: take the easy way out and back off, like everyone wants him to do; or face a major confrontation that will require him to put everything on the line--his job, his marriage, and his freedom? This film encourages people to stand up for what they know is right, particularly as it pertains to taking God's truths into society to address social issues. It addresses the spirit of retreat as it pertains to engaging the culture that has developed within the Church.Director: Pat NeceratoWriter: Pat NeceratoStars: James Russo, Paul Rodriguez, Rusty Joiner, Jocelyn Cruz, Victoria Gates, Christopher Mann",

His heart is seeking vengeance on those responsible for landing him in jail, but he's also very interested in finding the gold he was accused of stealing. In his quest, he finds himself in the small town of Fairplay, California where Kincaid learns that love is far more powerful than hate and that redemption is more precious than gold.

Trying to fill a void in her life, Maggie feels the need to locate her birth mother. What she finds is not what she hoped for. Maggie finds a mother that does not love her or want her. Maggie gets caught up in this woman's world. After a few months enough becomes enough and when all hope is lost, one desperate night she reaches her breaking point. In a rage, she releases her frustrations by destroying the seedy hotel room that has been her home. At her feet falls a Bible, and it is then she realizes that there is only one thing that can break the bondage she is in and that is Jesus Christ our Savior. She realizes through God's Word that he has a better plan for her life. Finding the courage she runs away from the nightmare she has been living. With the faith of a mustard seed, Maggie has no place to go but living on the streets alone, broke and scared. Maggie meets just the right people, Max and Grace, who will make her passage a reality. Grace (Sheran Keyton Goodspeed) gives her shelter and wisdom, while Max (Mike Norris), broken himself, becomes a father figure.

One time, on her way to a meeting, she was captured by the Chinese Communist Party's police and endured extremely brutal torture. When it was discovered that she was pregnant, the police utilized despicable methods to force her to take medicine so that she had a miscarriage. In order to conceal this crime, the police inhumanely injected her with a substance that would cause schizophrenia, and administered medicine at the same time. They did this for five months in an attempt to erase her memory. Li Yan was ravaged so much that she was in a trance. Gradually, she started hallucinating and became mentally unwell….

An auto mishap en route leaves her stranded, and Alza winds up on the doorstep of a reclusive farmer named Lincoln (Jefferson Moore) whose main goal in life is to be left alone. In the moment of Alza's greatest desperation, a deal is struck - Lincoln and his antique Chevy pickup will transport her the rest of the way for the price of $1000; the only caveat - no interstate highways. Amidst nonstop head-butting (attributed to Alza's spoiled arrogance and Lincoln's general grumpiness), the mismatched pair sets out on a three-day odyssey of misadventures along the highways and byways of America, where they encounter rat-infested motels, convenience store holdups, rural rabbit stalkers, and a star struck couple from the local trailer park. Best of all, they are forced to encounter each other, as the two worlds of the princess and the hermit collide at every turn.Director: Jefferson MooreStarring: Christina Karis, Jefferson Moore, Keith McGill, Pattie Crawford, Tom Luce, Matt Wallace",

The Lord Jesus told us that only honest people can enter the kingdom of heaven; only honest people can be people of the kingdom. This movie tells the story of the Christian Cheng Nuo's experience of God's work and the course of her pursuit to become an honest person in life.Cheng Nuo used to be a doctor. Even after believing in God, when she encounters things that impinge on her own interest and face in her day-to-day life, she still can't help but lie and deceive. In the face of trials and tribulations she even develops misunderstandings and gripes about God, but through seeking the truth time after time and undergoing the judgment and chastisement of God's words, she gains an understanding of the root of her dishonesty and her selfish, deceitful satanic nature. She begins to focus on pursuing the truth to resolve her tendency to lie and the deceit in her heart. Later when she is arrested by the Chinese Communist Party government while performing her duty and suffers devastating torture, she is ready to die before telling a lie and refuses to deny God. She bears a beautiful, resounding witness for God. Cheng Nuo is able to gradually become an honest person, and truly love and submit to God. So what really is her story?",

Debbie Laramie (Crystal Bernard) leaves her life in Dallas and moves to a small town called Paraíso, in the state of Texas. Once settled, Debbie and her teenage son must help the small community find its way back to God. Debbie's fearless strategy further contradicts the rigid congregation members' way of thinking, until a catastrophic event forces them to join forces. An old stable is the only option they have to continue as a church. With the help of supporters and even opponents, Debbie turns challenge into opportunity, bringing new life and trust in God to a community that so desperately needs it.

He had been a sensible and well-behaved boy since he was little. His parents and his teachers were very fond of him. While going to middle school, he became infatuated with internet computer games. He would frequently skip classes in order to go to the internet café. His parents did their utmost to help him break his gaming addiction. Unfortunately, Li Xinguang's addiction became worse and worse. He became dispirited and slowly changed into a troublesome boy. … When Li Xinguang's parents felt that they were at their wit's end, they heard that God is capable of saving people, helping them break their gaming addiction and break free from Satan's corruption. As a result, they decided to believe in God and looked forward to God saving their son. From God's words, they understood the source of mankind's corruption and depravity. They saw the truth of man's darkness and evil and they understood that only God can save people and set them free from Satan's corruption and affliction. All Xinguang had to do was to believe in God and understand the truth, and he would be able to break his gaming addiction. As a result, they spread the gospel to Xinguang and guided Xinguang to read God's words. They prayed to God and asked Him to save their son and help him break his gaming addiction. … After a fight, Xinguang started praying to God and relying on God. Under the guidance of God's words, he eventually broke his gaming addiction and freed himself from Satan's corruption and affliction.

She doesn't like to offend others. She believes herself to be a good person because she is kind and agreeable with others. But only after she accepts God's gospel of the last days and undergoes the judgment and chastisement of God's words does she have an awakening, and realize that she's not a true good person. Rather, she lives based on satanic philosophies, and is a very selfish, cunning \"nice guy.\" She resolves in her heart to seek the truth and become a good person who is honest and upright…. What experiences did Yang Huixin go through that allowed her to undergo such a transformation?Special statement: This video production was produced as a not-for-profit piece by The Church of Almighty God.

Since she believed in God, she was secretively monitored by the Chinese Communist government and captured by their police. The police forced her to sell out the leaders of the church as well as the church's finances. They attempted to use her family ties as a weapon in attacking her emotionally. They surrounded her and they did not let her sleep for half a month in order to break her resolve. She faced the relentless torment of the Chinese Communist Party's police. She was continuously in a highly stressful, frightening state. In this dangerous environment, she prayed over and over again to God and asked God to protect her so she could stand firm and bear witness. Under the guidance and leadership of Almighty God's word, she saw through the crafty schemes of the police and she withstood their repeated torture. In the end, under the protection of Almighty God, she was miraculously able to escape from the midst of the devil's den! After experiencing the Chinese Communist government's persecution, she saw clearly that they are evil demons and that they hate the truth. Their essence is that of a reactionary evil enemy of God. She saw firsthand God's sovereignty over everything and His wondrous deeds. She felt God's care and love in every possible manner. She resolved to give her entire life to God and to fulfill her duties as one of His creation in order to repay God's grace!",

      "description": "Christian Movie | \"Where Is My Home\" | Heartwarming and Touching Family Movie (Full Movie)Wenya's parents separated when she was two, and after that she lived with her father and stepmother. Her stepmother couldn't stand her and was always arguing with her father. He had little choice—he had to send Wenya to her mother's house, but her mother was fully focused on running her business and didn't have any time to take care of Wenya, so she was often shuttled off to her relatives' and friends' homes to be fostered. After so many years of a life of foster care, young Wenya felt lonely and helpless, and longed for the warmth of a home. Only when her father and stepmother divorced did she return to her father's side, and from then on had a home, for better or for worse.Once Wenya grew up, she was very cautious and obedient, and she studied hard. But just as she was working hard to prepare for her college entrance examinations, misfortune came upon her: Her mother had a brain hemorrhage and became paralyzed and bedridden. Her stepfather abandoned her mother and even took control over all of her assets, and then her father was hospitalized with liver cancer…. Wenya could not possibly take on the burden of the household, so all she could do was plead with relatives and friends, but she was turned down …Just as Wenya was suffering and without recourse, two friends of her mother preached God's gospel to them. They came to understand the root of pain in people's lives from the words of God, and understood that only if people come in front of God can they gain God's protection and live in happiness. Only through the comfort of God's words were mother and daughter able to come out from their pain and helplessness. Wenya genuinely experienced the love and mercy of God; she finally felt the warmth of a home, and came into a true home …AWARDS & NOMINATIONSSpirit Award, Churches Making Movies Christian Film Festival, United States, 2018International Humanitarian Platinum Award, World Humanitarian Awards, Indonesia, 2018Best Indie Feature Film, Five Continents International Film Festival, Venezuela, 2018Nominee for Best Screenplay, International Christian Film Festival, United States, 2018Nominee for Evangelism Award, Nominee for Best Foreign Feature, Great Lakes Christian Film Festival, United States, 2018#fullmovie #familymovie #christianmovies",

What is the spiritual world and how do angels, both faithful and fallen, fit into this unseen realm? The answers to these questions and more in Amir's new teaching, The Dead See!Behold Israel with Amir Tsarfatiwww.BeholdIsrael.org",

I'm always fascinated to see how fast a symbol of Armageddon populates our collective mind and triggers our survival instinct.
