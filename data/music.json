What is the spiritual world and how do angels, both faithful and fallen, fit into this unseen realm?

Our prayer is that this message would encourage you to search for God in every season, and put your trust in Him during every storm. Finding God in the Storm Jonah 1:4 ESV But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. Jonah 4:3 ESV \"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.” Jonah 4:5-6 ESV Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. Psalm 121:5 ESV The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade on your right hand. 2 Samuel22:34ESV He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights. Jonah 2:1 ESV Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,",

            "description": "“I didn’t have to change myself, I can just be myself.” --Tori Kelly#iamsecond#torikelly#WCFTo supportVertiZontalMediaclick onDonate.“People all around me all the time would say, ‘Oh, you’re such an amazing singer,’ and that became my identity in a lot of ways…I’m the singer.”When singer-songwriter Tori Kelly was signed to a record label at the age of 12, it felt like she was being given the world.Instead what followed was series of disappointments, broken promises, and a laundry list of things she was told she needed to change about her look or her personality in order to be a success. “I was this singer…if I failed, then people would be disappointed.”Tori found herself knocking on closed door after closed door, feeling increasingly discouraged. But, when she stepped away from noise and judgment of the industry, and took some time by herself in quiet, she found something she didn’t expect: her voice. “Those moments in my bedroom, when it was just me and my notebook, that’s when I really got into songwriting more…It was this slow, building process that wasn’t forced. There was no ‘you’ve gotta try this, and you’ve gotta be this, and you’ve gotta have this different personality. I didn’t have to change myself, I could just be myself. ”Today, Tori has recorded two full length albums, performed sold out tours and tv appearances, and been nominated for a Grammy. She sat down with I Am Second to share her story and a few things she wishes she could tell the 12 year old girl she used to be.Subscribe to I Am Second:https://bit.ly/30csfiFWatch more stories at:https://www.iamsecond.com/Like us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/IamSecond/Follow us on Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/iamsecond/Follow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/iamsecond",

            "description": "Nabeel Asif Qureshi (1983-2017) was raised as a devout Ahmadi Muslim. After spending several years examining the evidence for Christianity and Islam with his friend David Wood, Nabeel became a Christian while attending Eastern Virginia Medical School. Nabeel founded a ministry called \"Acts 17 Apologetics\" with his friend David, but he went on to join the speaking team for Ravi Zacharias International Ministries. His ongoing studies took him to Biola University, Duke University, and Oxford University, and led to three books: \"Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus,\" \"No God But One,\" and \"Answering Jihad.\" Following a battle with stomach cancer, Nabeel passed away on September 16, 2017. He is survived by his wife Michelle (who carries on his ministry) and his daughter Ayah. In this video, Nabeel Qureshi is joined by Lee Strobel and Mark Mittelberg (and by Ravi Zacharias and David Wood via recordings), as he shares his testimony about leaving Islam and coming to Christ.

            "description": "Justin Bieber has gone through so much in his life and his journey to Jesus Christ was nothing easy. In this mini movie, Justin's full life story along with his faith in God is showcased. Being exposed to an extreme level of popularity and fame at such a young age, Justin has gone through so much. It is very rare to see true Christians who are saved and are still working in Hollywood/Music/Entertainment Industry. Justin is definitely on the right track and I encourage you all to pray for him and his walk with Jesus. He is very active when it comes to sharing his faith in Jesus. He has never appeared to be ashamed of Jesus and doesn't hold back on speaking about his faith, so I want to thank him for his change of heart and spreading the good news.
