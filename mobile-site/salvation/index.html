        <h3>Embraced by Grace</h3>

        <div>
          <blockquote>
            In every dawn, there is a silent promise. When the shadows seem thicker, when the path narrows and your heart grows heavy, remember: you never walk alone.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            The same God who painted the heavens with stars knows every tear you've shed. Every dream deferred, every wound hidden - none of it goes unnoticed in his eyes.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            Perhaps today you feel small in the face of challenges. Perhaps the scars of the past still whisper doubts in your heart. But the truth is greater than any fear: you are infinitely loved, not because of what you have achieved, but simply because you exist.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            This is the silent revolution of Christ's love - that we were loved first, unconditionally. That our stumbles don't disqualify us from grace. That there is hope even when we can't see it.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            Allow yourself to rest in this love today. Let it heal, restore and renew. For the journey continues, and beyond the clouds, the sun has never stopped shining.

    <h2 class="section-title">What is the Gospel?</h2>
    <p class="section-subtitle">
      The message of hope, love, and eternal life.
    </p>

    <div class="gospel-explanation">
      <p>
        The word <strong>“Gospel”</strong> means <em>“Good News”</em>. But why is it good news?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel is the story of God's love for humanity. It starts with a problem: <strong>sin separated us from God</strong>. Every person has fallen short of God's perfect standard.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”<br><span>Romans 3:23</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        But God, in His great love, provided the solution. He sent His Son, <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, to live a perfect life, die on the cross for our sins, and rise again to offer us eternal life.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.”<br><span>John 3:16</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The Gospel is an invitation. An invitation to be forgiven, restored, and to begin a new life with God, both now and for eternity.

        <h2>1. Justification</h2>
        <p>
          In the Bible, justification refers to God declaring a person righteous in his sight, not based on their own actions, but on the merit of Jesus Christ. It's a legal declaration of forgiveness and acceptance, not a process of becoming righteous. The action of declaring or making righteous in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."
          <br><span>Romans 3:10-12</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.”
          <br><span>Romans 3:23-24</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          “The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.”
          <br><span>Isaiah 53:6</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement,[i] through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus."
          <br><span>Romans 3:21-26</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."
          <br><span>Isaiah 53:6</span>

      </div>
      
    
      <div class="box">
        <h2>2. Sanctification</h2>
        <p>
          The ongoing process of becoming more Holy, being transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. To not be behave like the world. To be transformed by the renewing of your mind (Reading the Bible & Prayer talking to Jesus), To be set apart to God to be used for his Purpose and Special Use, to bring him Glory.  But to be conformed to the image of Christ. To be more be more like him. To be more Holy.
          <br><span>Romans 12-1:2</span>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “For this is the will of God, that you be sanctified [separated and set apart from sin]: that you abstain and back away from sexual immorality.”
          <br><span> Thessalonians 4:3</span>

      <div class="box">
        <h2>3. Glorification</h2>
        <p>
          In the Bible, glorification refers to the final stage of salvation, where believers are transformed into the perfect likeness of Jesus Christ. This transformation involves both the spiritual and physical aspects of a believer, resulting in a perfected state of holiness and complete freedom from sin. Glorification is the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan for humanity. 
          <br><span>1 Cor 15:50-55</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Final Stage of Salvation</h3>
            <p>Glorification is the final step in the process of salvation, building upon justification (the initial forgiveness of sins) and sanctification (the ongoing process of becoming more holy).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Transformation into Christ's Likeness</h3>
            <p>Glorification involves being conformed to the image of Christ, both in character and in the resurrected body. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Perfected Holiness</h3>
            <p>This transformation results in believers being made holy, pure, and blameless, free from the imperfections and consequences of sin. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Ressurection and Eternal Life</h3>
            <p>Glorification is closely associated with the resurrection of the dead and the receiving of a glorified, eternal body. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>God's Final Work</h3>
            <p>It is God's final work of grace upon believers, removing the final remnants of sin and bringing them into His presence in glory. </p>

          <details>
            <summary>How to Pray When You're Broken</summary>
            <p>
              Even at times when we can't express our words, God understands our hearts. Praying when we're broken doesn't require eloquence, just sincerity. The Bible shows us examples of people who cried out with tears, sighs and even silence - and were heard. In this article, you will learn that the most important thing is not “how to speak right”, but to open up to God as you are. He draws near to those with wounded hearts and loves to listen to you, even in the midst of pain. Start by saying, “Lord, I need you,” and let Him do the rest.

          <!-- Item 2 -->
          <details>
            <summary>Does God Really Hear Me?</summary>
            <p>
              This is a common question: “Does God really hear me?”. The answer is: yes, He does! The Bible states that the eyes of the Lord are attentive to the righteous and His ears are open to their cry (Psalm 34:15). God is not far away; He is close to everyone who sincerely calls on Him. Even if you don't feel something immediately, trust: He is listening. In this article, we talk about God's promises to those who seek answers and how to cultivate a confident prayer life. Keep praying. He is listening, and at the right time, He will answer.

          <!-- Item 3 -->
          <details>
            <summary>God's Promises for Times of Struggle</summary>
            <p>
              We all face difficult days - fear, anxiety, loneliness or doubts. At such times, it is vital to remember God's promises. He said that He would never leave us nor forsake us (Hebrews 13:5) and that all things work together for good for those who love Him (Romans 8:28). This article brings together powerful verses and words of encouragement to strengthen you in times of struggle. Read, meditate and declare these promises over your life. When you anchor yourself in the Word, the storm may rage on, but your faith remains firm.
